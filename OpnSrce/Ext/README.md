# Ext/Sencha Related Plugins and Services



## Ext Filter Parser Service

The idea behind the ExtFilterParser Service is to provide an easy interface between a ExtJS4 Data Store and the Symfony backend. Using this service, you can easily integrate grid filters into your DQL or other database queries.

### Main Features

* Easily integrates into an existing Symfony2 project.
* Parse filters automatically from $_GET and $_POST as well as manually.
* Easily integrate filters into a Doctrine QueryBuilder object.

### Things to Change in the Future

* Add Support for Boolean Filters
* PhpDoc compiled documentation. Most of the necessary markup is there, but I'd like to compile it.

### How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute, just fork the repo. I'd love to have as many eyes as possible on this project and see it grow.
